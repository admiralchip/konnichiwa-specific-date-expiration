Konnichiwa! Specific Date Expiration makes it possible for subscriptions to expire on a specific admin-defined date. Tested with Konnichiwa! 0.7.6.

== Description ==

Set specific expiration dates for your subscription plans (eg. 2016-07-23). 

== Features ==

*  Set the specific date on which you want subscriptions to your subscription plan to expire.

*  Subscriptions expire at a defined date as set by you.

*  Set specific dates for each subscription plan. 

*  The subscription duration of the subscription plan set in the main Konnichiwa! settings will be ignored and the expiration date that you defined will be used instead.

*  Includes a fix to a bug that tells a user who has an active subscription that their subscription is expired. Expired subscriptions are DELETED from the database periodically. With this, you don't need to use the Konnichiwa! Handle Expired Subscriptions plugin / snippet.

*  Konnichiwa! Membership plugin must be installed in order to use it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin by going to Plugins > Add New > Upload then click on install.
2. Go to Settings > Konnichiwa! SDE to use it and set specific expiration dates.
